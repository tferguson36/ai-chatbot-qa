The Cognitive Enhancement Blueprint:
A Guide to Powerful Protocols for Reducing Brain Aging
Exercise, a potent ally in mitigating the effects of aging, plays a crucial role in protecting and
preserving cognitive function. These beneficial effects are likely driven, at least in part, by the
boost in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – a myokine and neurotrophic factor
produced in the muscles and brain in response to vigorous exercise. BDNF is a powerful player
in metabolism, aging, and various aspects of cognitive function, behavior, and memory. It stands
out as a significant driving force for enhancing the brain's neuroplasticity and promoting
neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons. It is crucial in embryonic development but
necessary in specific brain areas throughout the lifecycle because it's the foundation of memory.
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to environmental
stimuli. It facilitates learning new skills and altering synaptic connections based on new
experiences, increasing the brain's resilience.

As you might expect, the primary source of BDNF is the brain, where it concentrates in the
learning and memory centers, but many other tissues produce it, including the heart, lungs, gut,
and a few more. Unfortunately, BDNF production decreases as we age, with important
implications for brain health. The upshot: fewer neurons (and the connections between them),
making learning and memory formation harder.

Lifestyle behaviors can counter some of the effects of brain aging.
Certain lifestyle behaviors mitigate the effects of brain aging, fostering cognitive vitality and
resilience. A common feature of these behaviors is their capacity to drive beneficial increases
not only in brain BDNF but in plasma BDNF, too. This dual outcome extends BDNF's influence
beyond the brain and indicates that plasma BDNF likely can cross the blood-brain barrier,
potentiating its effects. Here are some behaviors that promote BDNF.

Exercise
The benefits of exercise on mental and cognitive health are well established. Many of these
benefits likely relate directly to exercise's capacity to increase BDNF levels. But not all exercise
is created equal. Exercise intensity matters and is critical for stimulating increased BDNF
expression.
Intense exercise promotes the production of lactate, a metabolic byproduct of glucose
metabolism. The body "shuttles" lactate from the muscles to various tissues like the heart and
brain, serving as an energy source. Once in the brain, lactate acts as a signaling molecule to
activate BDNF.

Lactate is crucial in elevating BDNF levels, with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) notably
boosting BDNF more than moderate continuous exercise.

Optimal duration for BDNF boost: Long duration (about 40 minutes) moderate- to
vigorous-intensity exercise (at least 65 percent max heart rate) elicited the greatest
effects on BDNF levels – nearly one-third higher than before exercising – in young,
healthy men. However, a 30-minute session is relatively common in most studies and
appears sufficient to induce sustained (24-hour) improvements in memory.
Short-term spike, long-term effects: The rise in BDNF levels following exercise is
short-lived, usually less than an hour post-exercise. However, the long-term impact is
considerable, with animal studies demonstrating that exercise leads to increased
neurogenesis in the brain.
High-intensity cycling outperforms prolonged cycling for BDNF increases: Six
minutes of high-intensity cycling intervals (six 40-second intervals at 100 percent of VO2
peak) increased every metric of circulating BDNF by four to five times more than
prolonged, low-intensity cycling (90 minutes at 25 percent VO2 peak). The four- to
fivefold increase in plasma-derived BDNF correlated with a sixfold increase in plasma
lactate.
Enhanced plasma BDNF and brain volume in older adults: After participating in a
six-month dance program, older adults' brain volumes increased in areas crucial for
memory, and plasma BDNF levels rose significantly.

Mechanistically, BDNF plays a crucial role in cognitive improvements, as demonstrated in
animal studies, where blocking BDNF's action reverses the cognitive benefits of exercise,
underscoring the vital link between physical activity and brain health.
To sum up, exercise significantly boosts BDNF – essential for cognitive health – through various
means. Extended moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise sessions notably increase BDNF
levels, with the benefits persisting well beyond the exercise period. High-intensity cycling, in
particular, demonstrates a remarkable ability to boost BDNF levels, tied closely to increased
lactate production. The effects of exercise-induced increases in BDNF are not limited to young
people: Older adults also experience enhanced brain volume and BDNF levels with regular
physical activity.
Rhonda's recommendations and personal practices
- Outdoor running: Engage in a 30-minute run outdoors, aiming for approximately 80 to
85 percent of your max heart rate. Repeat this two to three times weekly for optimal
results.
- High-intensity interval cycling: Start with a warm-up, followed by seven 45-second
cycling intervals at 90 to 95 percent of your max heart rate, with brief 15-second
recovery periods. Conclude with a cool-down. Perform this routine two to three times
weekly.
- Double Tabata cycling sessions: Execute two consecutive Tabata sets, each involving
20-second intervals at 90 to 95 percent of your max heart rate, interspersed with


10-second recovery periods. Complete this 16 times with an extended break between
each Tabata set. Aim for one to two sessions weekly.
Norwegian 4x4 HIIT protocol: Perform four minutes of intense exercise at the highest
heart rate you can maintain, followed by three minutes of recovery. Repeat this cycle
four times. Incorporate this protocol into your routine once a week.

How exercise drives BDNF production.
Exercise promotes the release of lactate, a myokine produced in skeletal muscle. Lactate enters the bloodstream and
then crosses the blood-brain barrier, promoting BDNF production.

Hot baths and sauna use
Engaging in heat therapy through soaking in a hot tub or enjoying a sauna session may also
elevate your BDNF levels, enhancing brain health. This effect aligns with the known benefits of
heat therapy in reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia and
Alzheimer's.

Hot baths boost BDNF: A 20-minute hot water soak at 42°C (108°F) increased BDNF
in healthy young men to levels that were two-thirds higher than before soaking. Levels
remained elevated for 15 minutes afterward.

Sauna use increases BDNF: A ten-week regimen of regular heat exposure in a sauna
at 80°C (176°F) increased BDNF levels more effectively than light-intensity exercise,
positioning sauna bathing as a promising method for promoting brain health through
BDNF production.

Rhonda's recommendations and personal practices:
- Dry sauna protocol: Spend 20 to 30 minutes in a dry sauna at temperatures ranging
from 79.4°C to 82.2°C (175°F to 180°F) with about 10-20 percent humidity. Aim for three
to four sessions weekly for optimal results.
- Saltwater jacuzzi regimen: Enjoy 30 minutes in a saltwater jacuzzi at 40°C (104°F).
Incorporate into your routine three to four times weekly.

Omega-3 fatty acids
Omega-3 fatty acids are indispensable for the development and function of the central nervous
system across all stages of life. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of cell
membranes and offer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
Three omega-3 fatty acids are essential to human health: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA),
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is in plant oils, such as
those from walnuts and flaxseeds. EPA and DHA are in the flesh and fats of fish and marine
animals. The EPA and DHA from marine sources are particularly potent in enhancing
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a key player in brain health and cognitive function.

Omega-3 increases BDNF: Multiple studies point to the BDNF-boosting effect of
omega-3s in humans, particularly at doses greater than 2 grams daily.

Long-term omega-3 boosts BDNF: Long-term supplementation (greater than 10
weeks) and moderate doses (about 1.5 grams daily) have more robust effects on BDNF
levels, especially in people under the age of 50.
Omega-3 and trauma recovery: When trauma patients received omega-3 fatty acid-rich
fish oil supplements, their proBDNF (a BDNF precursor) levels were nearly five times
higher than those who received a placebo. Trauma patients with higher proBDNF levels
were also less likely to have depression – a common occurrence after trauma.

Rhonda's personal practices:
Approximately 2 grams of triglyceride-form EPA in the morning and 2 grams of
triglyceride-form DHA in the evening.

Polyphenols
Polyphenols are a large family of naturally occurring organic compounds characterized by
multiple phenol units. Flavonoids – a type of polyphenol widely found in fruits, vegetables, tea,
wine, and cocoa – are known for their diverse beneficial health effects, including antioxidant and
anti-inflammatory properties, including in the brain.

High dietary flavonoid intake improves BDNF: Increasing fruit and vegetable intake to
include high flavonoid content (>15 milligrams per 100 grams) increased serum BDNF
levels, which correlated with improved global cognition.
Flavonoid-rich cocoa boosts BDNF and cognition: Older adults consuming a
high-flavanol cocoa drink (494 milligrams of flavanols) for 12 weeks increased serum
BDNF levels, correlating with cognitive performance improvements.

Rhonda's recommendations and personal practices:
- Morning smoothie recipe: one cup of organic frozen blueberries, blackberries,
strawberries, raspberries, some kale leaves, and avocado.
- Daily afternoon cocoa flavanol drink: one scoop of CocoaVia cocoa mix with 500
milligrams of flavanols mixed with hot water and stevia.

Zinc
Zinc is the most abundant trace element in the brain, affecting BDNF expression and activity by
switching on the activity of proteins involved in converting the biologically inactive form of BDNF
(pro-BDNF) to mature BDNF. The RDA for adult males is 11 milligrams per day and 8 milligrams
per day for adult females. Approximately 12 percent of adults in the United States don't get
enough zinc in their diet, and as many as 20 percent of older adults don't get enough.

In a meta-analysis of multiple studies where participants received 30 milligrams of
supplemental zinc daily for three months, zinc supplementation enhanced circulating
levels of BDNF better than a placebo.

Meditation
Meditation, a practice rooted in ancient tradition, has been validated by modern science for
enhancing cognitive functions. Human studies consistently show that regular meditation can
improve executive function and memory. This cognitive sharpening is primarily due to increased
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a key molecule in brain plasticity, learning, and
memory.
Experienced meditators who participated in a three-month-long yoga and meditation retreat had
threefold increases in their plasma BDNF levels compared to their pre-retreat levels. The
meditators' self-reported scores for depression and anxiety (which were already low) decreased
by about 60 percent.

Mental training
It's well-known that physical exercise boosts BDNF levels, but mental exercise is equally potent.
Engaging the brain with new and novel experiences fosters neuroplasticity – its remarkable
capacity for growth, adaptation, and change.

When sedentary, older women with mild cognitive impairment engaged in eight weeks of
computer-based mental training, their working memory increased by 22 percent, and
their processing speed improved by 10 percent – gains that lasted at least six months
after the intervention. Plasma BDNF levels increased by 26 percent in women who
engaged in mental training but dropped by 13 percent in women who didn't.

<<section>>

Probiotics
An abundance of evidence points to a strong connection between BDNF levels and the gut
microbiome, the collection of microorganisms that live in the human digestive tract. Probiotics
may support a healthy microbiome, bolstering cognitive function.


When people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment took 800 milligrams of a
Lactobacillus plantarum probiotic supplement for 12 weeks, they experienced rapid
improvements in attention, working memory, and verbal memory. The greatest
improvements in cognitive function in people who took the probiotic occurred in those
with greater increases in serum BDNF levels.
Several clinical trials have found that probiotics increased BDNF levels in people with
neurological disorders or depression, especially when the probiotics were enriched with
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, two microbes associated with gut health.

<<section>>

Dietary patterns
The typical Western diet, rich in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, reduces BDNF levels.
However, healthy dietary patterns increase BDNF.
- A low-carb diet plus HIIT: When adults with metabolic syndrome followed a low-carb
diet for four weeks (about 40 percent fewer calories than usual), their BDNF levels
increased by 20 percent.

Higher BDNF levels translated to better cognitive performance, with study
participants taking about 14 percent less time to complete a dynamic test of
cognitive speed and flexibility.
○ Adding HIIT to the dietary regimen increased BDNF levels by 38 percent – even
when measured 72 hours after the workout.
Moderate caloric intake: When healthy overweight or obese men and women followed
a three-month reduced calorie diet requiring a 25 percent reduction in caloric intake, their
BDNF levels increased by 50 percent.

There's more to BDNF than its role in the brain.
The presence of BDNF in capillary beds and throughout the body's systemic circulation hints at
the molecule's capacity to perform in various contexts. For example, BDNF is a biomarker for
some disease states.

Suicide risk: BDNF levels are typically lower among women who have attempted
suicide than women who have not.
Parkinson's disease: Low BDNF levels are often seen in early-stage Parkinson's
disease and may serve to distinguish between Parkinson's disease and essential tremor.
○ High BDNF levels may manifest in later stages of Parkinson's disease – possibly
the body's attempt to compensate for more severe symptoms.
Trauma and depression link: Short-term increases in BDNF levels that occur with
physical or other trauma often correlate with better outcomes for the risk of developing
depression.
Gut permeability: BDNF regulates the expression of tight junction proteins – essential
for maintaining gut barrier integrity.
Stroke: BDNF levels are markedly lower immediately after a stroke and may predict
stroke recovery outcomes.

Conclusion
Lifestyle is a powerful tool for mitigating the effects of aging on cognitive function, with
exercise – particularly the vigorous kind – taking the lead. Exercise promotes muscles'
production of lactate, a metabolic byproduct that increases the production of BDNF, a crucial
player in brain health. Other lifestyle factors, such as hot baths, sauna use, and meditation, and
dietary components, such as omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and dietary fiber, also contribute to
BDNF production. However, the effects of BDNF extend beyond the brain, serving as a
biomarker for various diseases and supporting gut health.
An abundance of evidence points to the multifaceted role of BDNF and underscores the
importance of adopting behaviors that promote its increase for overall cognitive well-being.
