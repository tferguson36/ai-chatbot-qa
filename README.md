# QA Chatbot

This project is meant to encapsulate the basic construction of an LLM chatbot that is restricted to
accessing a provided knowledge set (i.e. a particular website, pdf, etc.).

For this example I have converted a longish technical article on Rhonda Fitzpatrick's BDNF protocols from PDF to text.
You will also notice that for this example, I have added a delimitter to help distinguish between clearly different sections of the text in order to aid the chunking/embedding process.

I followed [this tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings) along with the OpenAI docs which can be found at the same link.
