# QA Chatbot

This project is meant to encapsulate the basic construction of an LLM chatbot that is restricted to
accessing a provided knowledge set (i.e. a particular website, pdf, etc.).

For this example I have converted a longish technical article on BDNF from PDF to text.

I followed [this tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings) along with the OpenAI docs which can be found at the same link.
